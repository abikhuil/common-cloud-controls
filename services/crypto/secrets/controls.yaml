    title: Least Privilege Access
    objective: |
      Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to
      secrets. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based
      access control (ABAC) to enforce the principle of least privilege.

          When a user or application attempts to access a secret, the system
          MUST verify that the user or application has the necessary
